# FIFO Page-Replacement Algorithm

This Java CLI program will serve as a case study requirement for the "Operating Systems" course. FIFO page-replacement algorithm is a simple approach for virtual memory management. It operates like a queue, replacing the page that has been in the memory for the longest time, if a requested page does not exist within the memory.
